## Custom Meme Generator

This program creates a custom meme based on inputs selected by the user.

### Programmers:

Tanner Bauserman : Tobi Lott : OK Schlatter : Jax Zinkie

Note about Discord Bot: after the bot is run, three lines of red code appear in the command line. These
are not errors, its just telling the info about the api and that the bot is connected to the server.
